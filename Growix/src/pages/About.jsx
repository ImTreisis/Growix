      <p className="text-cocoa/90">Growix is designed for dancers who want to find dance workshops, as well as for anyone who wants to organize and post them. The problem is that there is no single place to find all available workshops. The goal is to allow users to easily search for, bookmark, follow, and create workshops.</p>
      <p className="text-cocoa/90">Browse workshops by style and level, save your favorites, and create your own events.</p>
